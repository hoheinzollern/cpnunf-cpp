	Contextual Petri Nets Unfolder

An unfolder for Contextual Petri Nets based on the original work of Stefan
Schwoon for Mora, a spin-off of the Mole unfolder for Contextual Petri Nets.

1. DEPENDENCIES

In order to build and use this software you need to have CMake and GLib
installed. Future plans of development will dismiss GLib in favor of the
C++ standard library structures. In order to meet these requirements in a
debian based system you must execute from the terminal:

	sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev cmake

2. DOWNLOAD, BUILD AND RUN

This software is located at:

http://github.com/hoheinzollern/Contextual-Petri-Net-Unfolder

To download the latest version of the source you can either use git:

	git clone git://github.com/hoheinzollern/Contextual-Petri-Net-Unfolder.git unfolder

.. or svn:

	svn co https://svn.github.com/hoheinzollern/Contextual-Petri-Net-Unfolder.git unfolder

After you checked out the sources you can build them:

	cd unfolder
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

Now run like this:

	./unfolder your_example.ll_net

The input format are PEP low-level nets extended with an additional section for
read arcs. Some simple examples are in the Examples/ directory, hopefully they
are enough to clarify the input syntax.

The unfolder produces dot-compatible output, so you can get a PDF file of the
result by saying

	./unfolder your_example.ll_net | dot -Tpdf > your_example.pdf
	xdg-open your_example.pdf

Right now the tool has the following restrictions:
* It works with safe nets only.
* It has not at all been thoroughly tested. In fact, it may very well
  crash on any example other than the ones in the Example/ directory.
  Let me know of any bugs you encounter, including the examples that
  cause them.

Please report any bugs you may encounter at:
